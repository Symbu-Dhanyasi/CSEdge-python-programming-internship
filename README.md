# Chatbot Documentation

### Overview
This Python script implements a simple chatbot using the `nltk` library for natural language processing. The chatbot responds to user queries and provides predefined responses for certain topics.

### Code Structure
The code consists of the following components:

1. Importing necessary libraries:
    ```python
    import nltk
    from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections
    ```

2. Defining patterns and responses:
    ```python
   pairs = [
    ['hi|hello|hey', ['Hello,Sir!', 'Hi Sir!', 'Hey,Sir!']],
    ['how are you?', ['I am doing well,sir, thank you Sir!', 'I am good Sir, thanks for asking Sir!']],
    ['what is your name?', ['I am a simple chatbot.', 'I am a chatbot designed for your assistance sir']],
    ['what can you do?', ['I can produce any source of information you need sir. Feel free to ask me anything!']],
    ['bye|goodbye', ['Have a great day,Sir!,Bye']],
    ['(.*) weather (.*)', ['Its 25 degress right now,Sir!']],
    ['(.*) news (.*)', ['India has Won  T20 World cup, Kalki movie crossed 1000 crore mark today.']],
    ['(.*) time (.*)', ['Its 12"0 clock sir!.']]
]
    ```

3. Creating a `Chat` object:
    ```python
    chat = Chat(pairs, reflections)
    ```

4. Defining a function to handle user input and generate chatbot response:
    ```python
   def chat_respond(inputs):
    return chat.respond(inputs)
'''

5. Defining the main function to interact with the chatbot:
    ```python
    def main():
       print("Hello sir! How May I Help you .")
    
        while True:
         inputs = input("You : ")
         response = chat_respond(inputs)
         print("Bot:",response)
         if inputs.lower() == 'bye':
            break
    ```

6. Executing the main function:
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

### Usage
To run the chatbot:
1. Ensure you have the `nltk` library installed. If not, you can install it using `pip install nltk`.
2. Copy the provided code into a Python script (e.g., `simple_chatbot.py`).
3. Run the script in a Python environment.
4. Interact with the chatbot by entering text input when prompted.

### Extending Functionality
To extend the functionality of the chatbot:
- Add more patterns and responses in the `pairs` list to handle a wider range of user queries.
- Integrate external APIs to provide real-time information on specific topics like weather, news, or time.
- Implement more sophisticated natural language processing techniques for better understanding of user queries."# CSEdge-python-programming-internship"
